import Config

# config/runtime.exs is executed for all environments, including
# during releases. It is executed after compilation and before the
# system starts, so it is typically used to load production configuration
# and secrets from environment variables or elsewhere. Do not define
# any compile-time configuration in here, as it won't be applied.
# The block below contains prod specific runtime configuration.

# ## Using releases
#
# If you use `mix release`, you need to explicitly enable the server
# by passing the PHX_SERVER=true when you start it:
#
#     PHX_SERVER=true bin/ash_learning start
#
# Alternatively, you can use `mix phx.gen.release` to generate a `bin/server`
# script that automatically sets the env var above.

  # ## Configuring the mailer
  #
  # In production you need to configure the mailer to use a different adapter.
  # Here is an example configuration for Mailgun:
  #
  #     config :ash_learning, AshLearning.Mailer,
  #       adapter: Swoosh.Adapters.Mailgun,
  #       api_key: System.get_env("MAILGUN_API_KEY"),
  #       domain: System.get_env("MAILGUN_DOMAIN")
  #
  # Most non-SMTP adapters require an API client. Swoosh supports Req, Hackney,
  # and Finch out-of-the-box. This configuration is typically done at
  # compile-time in your config/prod.exs:
  #
  #     config :swoosh, :api_client, Swoosh.ApiClient.Req
  #
  # See https://hexdocs.pm/swoosh/Swoosh.html#module-installation for details.
